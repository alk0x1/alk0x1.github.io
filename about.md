Hi!

My name is Alan Bertani. I am a very curious developer who are fascinated in Cybersecurity and .

What I really like is to know deeply how everything works, so I spend a lot of time learning the basics of computer science. That is the main reason why I like so much fields like exploit and malware development, blockchain, cryptographic protocols like Zero Knowledge Proofs etc. These topics force me to understand deeply how and why the techs that I use everyday works.

I will use this personal space to publish some of my personal projects, make some tutorials and talk about topics that I like. Hope it helps you in some way ;)

### My main interests
- **Privacy and descentralization**
  - In a world where personal data holds immense value, people probably will begin to give more value to their own data. Technologies such as Zero Knowledge Proofs and Blockchain can disrupt  a lot of fields by offering enhanced privacy and reliability, thereby reducing the reliance on intermediary services through innovations like smart contracts.
- **Malware and Exploit Development**
  - I honest think there's no better way to learn about how something work than building and breaking it. That's why learning about offensive security topics is so good to gain deep knowledge about how things work. For example to learn about how some vulnerability such as buffer overflow you need to understand well about the memory. Similarly developing a rootkit necessitates a deep understanding of computer architecture and Operational Systems. This is why I invest a lot of my free time making projects relationed with offensive security topics.
- **Functional Programming and Type Theory**
  - Just as offensive security gives me a deeper knowledge of technology in general Type Theory and Functional Programming provide me with a broader understanding of programming languages—how they work and why they function in this way. Which improve directly my problem solve capacity and my code quality.
- **Clean Code and Clean Architecture**
  - I have experience working with code that doesn't follow conventional practices, and I understand how unproductive this can be. In my opinion, one of the key responsibilities of a programmer is making decisions. Questions like 'Which language should I use?' or 'Should I go with Controllers and Services or Controllers and Use Cases?' 'Should I use 'if-else' or pattern matching?' and choosing between different frameworks are just a few examples of the decisions we face. While it's widely known that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, a solid understanding of the principles of Clean Code and Clean Architecture equips us with the tools to make these decisions effectively.
