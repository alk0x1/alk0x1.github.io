Hi!

My name is Alan Bertani. I am a very curious Backend developer who are fascinated in Cybersecurity.

What i really like in technology is to know deeply how everything works, so i spend a lot of time learning the basics of computer science and recently the basics of Blockchain and Ethereum.

I will use this personal space to publish some of my personal projects, make some tutorials and talk about topics that i like. Hope it helps you in some way ;)
